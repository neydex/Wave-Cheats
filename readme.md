**Info**

All free clients that I know are here for download.

.zip files as folder in .minecraft/versions. (if client doesnt work try adding -noverify to jvm args)

.jar files are mods, go to .minecraft/mods (Fabric or Forge)

exe/.msi are installers. Just run it.


**Best Clients:** (my opinion)


Ghost 1.8: Raven S1

Blatant 1.8: Vestige v3

Anarchy 1.12: Lambda

Newest version: LiquidBounce (LiquidLauncher)
